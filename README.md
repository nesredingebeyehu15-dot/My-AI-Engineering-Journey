# My AI Engineering Journey 🚀

Welcome to my official 3-year journey to become a world-class AI/ML Engineer! This repository is the live diary of my daily learning, projects, and growth.

**My Ultimate Goal:** To achieve a **$7,000/month** income as a professional AI/ML Engineer and to pursue my dream of becoming a Pilot.

**My Strategy:** A consistent, daily effort of 3 hours, guided by my AI Mentor.
